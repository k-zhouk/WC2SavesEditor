Warcraft 2 save files editor

In a galaxy far, far away there was once a game called "Warcraft 2".

By using magic words like "glitteringprises" or "itsagooddaytodie" it allowed to play much more easier. However, by using these magic words, rank at the end of a mission was the "Cheater". Not so nice to see, right?

This program allows you to get some additional resources by editing a save file. So no imput of magic words, no offending "Cheater" status. Isn't it nice?

Have fun :)

Notes:

    The resources (gold, wood and oil) are stored in a save file as 32 bits integer
    Funny bug- the resources are interpreted not just like 32 bit integer, but as SIGNED integer. Who on Earth would need -65536 gold? :)
