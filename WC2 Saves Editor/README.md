Warcraft 2 save files editor

In a galaxy far, far away once there was a game called "Warcraft 2".

By using magic words like "glitteringprises" or "itsagooddaytodie" it allowed to play much more easier. However, by using these magic words, player's rank at the end of a mission was the "Cheater". Not so nice to see, right?

This small program allows you to get some additional resources by editing a save file. So no input of magic words, no offending "Cheater" status. Isn't it nice?

Have fun :)

Notes:

    The resources (gold, wood and oil) are stored in a save file as 32 bit integers
    Funny bug- the resources are interpreted not just like 32 bit integers, but as SIGNED integers. Who on Earth would need -65536 of gold? :)
